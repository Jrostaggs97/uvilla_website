## Research highlights
I like trees and things like that. I work under the supervision of Dr. Annette Ostling (you can visit her lab website [here](https://sites.google.com/utexas.edu/ostlinglab/home?authuser=0))

Here are some buzzwords to remind me later on when I have time: PDEs, structured models, life history variation, niche theory, community ecology, biodiversity.
